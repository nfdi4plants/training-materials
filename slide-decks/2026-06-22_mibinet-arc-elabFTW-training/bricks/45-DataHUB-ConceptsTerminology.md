# Where do I store my ARC?

# ARC storage and sharing

![w:600](./../../../public/images-tm/arc-storagelocations-withnotes.drawio.png)

- DataHUB as "ground truth" / original clone
- You can sync and communicate all changes to your ARC via the DataHUB

<span style="font-size:0.8em"> :bulb: ARCitect and ARC commander provide options to avoid syncing large files (LFS = Large file storage) </span>

# Example setup to store and use ARCs

<div class=two-columns style="font-size: 25px">

  <div>
  
  ### Personal computer

  - work on small files
  - annotate metadata
  - add scripts, protocols
  
  ### Workstation / Server

  - work on large files
  - run computations
  
  </div>
  <div>

  ### FileShare
  
  - mount to local machine, sync ARC from there
  
  ### HPC

  - direct connection HPC to DataHUB (depends on security settings)
  - or mount to local machine and sync, ARC from there
  
  
  </div>

</div>

# **Projects** and **Groups** are not the same

- "Project" = ARC
- "Groups" = Group of users

---

## Project = ARC

- In the DataHUB, ARCs are called "projects"; they are the same.
- An ARC can be shared with individual users (invited as "members") or a group.

---

## DataHUB Groups

- A "Group" is a group of users with specific [permissions](#roles-and-permissions)
- A group can share ARCs
- A group can be invited to an ARC
- Groups can have subgroups

# ARC DataHUB members // ARC Investigation contacts <!-- fit -->

:bulb: Investigation contacts are not automatically invited as members to the ARC.
